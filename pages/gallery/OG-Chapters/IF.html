<h1>Imperial Fists</h1>
 <p>The Space Wolves (also Sky Warriors of Russ, Rout or Vlka Fenryka or Wolves of Fenris in Fenrisian) were the VI Legion of the twenty Space Marine Legions. 
    Their primarch is Leman Russ, and during the Great Crusade they gained a reputation as the Emperor's executioners and instruments of punishment.
    After the Horus Heresy and the resultant reforms, the legion was divided, its first and only time, into two chapters: 
    the new Space Wolves chapter retained the name of their parent Legion, while the second chapter took on the name of the Wolf Brothers. 
    The latter however suffered from mutation and were disbanded.  </p>
