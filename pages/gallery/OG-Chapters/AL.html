<h1>Alpha Legion</h1>
 <p>The Alpha Legion, also known as the Ghost Legion during the early Great Crusade, is the XX Legion of the original twenty Space Marine Legions. 
  They turned against the Emperor during the Horus Heresy, becoming Chaos Space Marines. Even before they turned to Chaos, the Alpha Legion were renowned as the most secretive of all the Legions.
  The Alpha Legion's most closely guarded secret, unbeknownst to all but a few outside the Legion, is that they had two primarchs; 
  Alpharius and his twin Omegon (sometimes referred to collectively as just 'Alpharius Omegon').</p>
